        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          In order to use the Service, you need to establish an Account. You are solely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password.

Please note that we may delete accounts (and all associated Content) that haven’t been used for an extended period of time.
        </p>
        <p className="my-4">
          Using our Service does not give you any legal right, title, or interest in our Service or the Content you access. You may not assign (or grant a sub-license of) your rights to use the Service, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Service. The Service, including the software used to implement the Service, as well as the software provided to you as a part of the Service (the “Software”), are protected by copyright, trademark, applicable intellectual property and other laws. These Terms do not grant you the right to use any trademarks, branding, or logos used in our Service. No portion of the Service may be reproduced in any form or by any means, except as expressly permitted in these Terms.

        <p className="my-4">
          Don’t misuse the Service. You agree not to engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Service (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service). Also, you agree not to access the Service using a method other than the interface and instructions we provide. For example, you may not: a) reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to extract the source code of the software used to access the Service or protocols used in the Service, unless this is required by law; b) attempt to disable or circumvent any security mechanisms used by the Service; c) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network; d) breach or otherwise circumvent any security or authentication measures; e) access, tamper with, or use non-public areas of the Service; f) interfere with or disrupt any user, host, or network, for example by sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing any part of the Service; g) plant malware or otherwise use the Service to distribute malware; h) access or search the Service by any means other than our publicly supported interfaces (for example, “scraping”). If your use of the Service or other behavior intentionally or unintentionally threatens our ability to provide the Service, we will take any reasonable steps to protect the Service, which may include suspension of your access to the Service.
